syllable rules

vowels a, e, i, o, u, sometimes y and w

dipthongs  oi, oy, ou, ow, au, aw, oo, and many others

consonants are all other letters which stop or limit the flow of air from the throat in speech.  
b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, qu, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z, ch, sh, th, ph, wh, ng, gh

every syllable in every word must have a vowels

"C" followed by "e, i or y" usually has the soft sound of "s"

"G" followed by "e, i or y" usually has the soft sound of j

when 2 consonants are joined together and form one new sound, they are a consonant digraph.  They count as one sound and one letter and are never seperated.  exp ch, sh, th, ph, and wh

when a syllable ends in a consonant and has only one vowel, that vowel is short. exp bed

when a syllable ends in a silent "e" , the silent "e" is a signal that the vowel in front of it is long. exp gene

when a syllable has 2 vowels togeter, the first vowel is usually long and the second is silent exp eat, boat 

when a syllable ends i any vowel and is the only vowel, that vowel is usually long exp o/pen, u/nit

when a vowel is followed by an "r" in the same syllable, that vowel is "r-controlled" it is not long or short. "R-controlled "er,ir,and ur"



1. to find the number of syllables:

-count the vowels in the word,
-subtract any silent vowels,  (like the silent "e/ed" at the end of a word or the second vowel when two vowels are together in a syllable)
-subtract one vowel from every diphthong, (diphthongs only count as one vowel sound)
-the number of vowel sounds left is the same as the number of syllables.

The number of syllables that you hear when you pronounce a word is the same as the number of vowels sounds heard. For example:
The word "came" has 2 vowels, but the "e" is silent, leaving one vowel sound andone syllable.
The word "outside" has 4 vowels, but the "e" is silent and the "ou" is a diphthong which counts as only one sound, so this word has only two vowels sounds and therefore, two syllables.

2. Divide between two middle consonants.
Split up words that have two middle consonants. For example:
hap/pen, bas/ket, let/ter, sup/per, din/ner, and Den/nis. The only exceptions are the consonant digraphs. Never split up consonant digraphs as they really represent only one sound. The exceptions are "th", "sh", "ph", "th", "ch", and "wh".

3. Usually divide before a single middle consonant.
When there is only one syllable, you usually divide in front of it, as in:
"o/pen", "i/tem", "e/vil", and "re/port". The only exceptions are those times when the first syllable has an obvious short sound, as in "cab/in".

4. Divide before the consonant before an "-le" syllable.
When you have a word that has the old-style spelling in which the "-le" sounds like "-el", divide before the consonant before the "-le". For example: "a/ble", "fum/ble", "rub/ble" "mum/ble" and "this/tle". The only exception to this are "ckle" words like "tick/le".

5. Divide off any compound words, prefixes, suffixes and roots which have vowel sounds.
Split off the parts of compound words like "sports/car" and "house/boat". Divide off prefixes such at "un/happy", "pre/paid", or "re/write". Also divide off suffixes as in the words "farm/er", "teach/er", "hope/less" and "care/ful". In the word "stop/ping", the suffix is actually "-ping" because this word follows the rule that when you add "-ing" to a word with one syllable, you double the last consonant and add the "-ing".
